# My-Instagram-Usage-Data-Analysis
Sabanci University DSA210 Introduction to Data Science course Fall 2023-2024 Term Project.
This project will be about my Instagram usage analysis.

## Motivation
In today's digital age, social media platforms play a significant role in our daily lives. However, excessive usage can impact productivity, mental health, and overall well-being. By monitoring my Instagram usage, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of my habits and patterns.

This project will allow me to identify trends in my usage, such as the time of day I am most active, the duration of my sessions, and how my activity aligns with my daily routines. Through this analysis, I hope to uncover insights about my relationship with social media and make more informed decisions about managing my time effectively.

Additionally, this project is an opportunity to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques to a real-world dataset, showcasing my ability to derive meaningful conclusions from personal data.


## Data Source
The data for this project will be collected directly from Instagram using;

##### Instagram Insights: Provides metrics like daily screen time, number of sessions, and activity breakdown.
##### Manual Logging: If required, I will record additional details manually, such as the type of activities (e.g., posting, browsing, messaging) and interactions.

## Data Fields

The dataset will include the following fields:

##### Date: The day the data was recorded.
##### Screen Time (minutes): Total time spent on Instagram each day.
##### Number of Sessions: Total number of times Instagram was opened during the day.
##### Most Active Time: The hour(s) of the day with the highest activity.
##### Activity Type Breakdown:
Browsing/Scrolling
Posting Content
Messaging
Watching Reels/Stories
Interactions:
Number of likes, comments, or direct messages sent.


## Data Collection Plan

##### Daily Tracking: Data will be logged at the end of each day for this semester (Fall 2024)
##### Storage: I will store the data in a structured format for ease of analysis.
##### Privacy: Only aggregated metrics will be used in the analysis; I will share no private information of mine.


## Methods
To analyze my Instagram usage data, I will employ the following techniques:

#### 1. Data Collection
##### Frequency: Data will be recorded daily for a predefined period (e.g., one month).
##### Sources: I will collect data directly from Instagram's shared personal data

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
##### Data Cleaning: I will ensure the dataset is free from missing or inconsistent entries.
##### Data Transformation: I will convert raw metrics into meaningful formats (e.g., calculating average daily screen time or session duration).
##### Feature Engineering: I will create derived metrics such as:
Average time per session.
Percentage of time spent on different activities.

#### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
I will analyze trends and patterns over time, such as:
Daily, weekly, and hourly activity levels.
Correlation between screen time and activity type.
Use statistical methods to summarize key findings.

#### 4. Visualization
I will create visual representations to make the data more interpretable:
Line charts for daily screen time trends.
Heatmaps for most active times during the day.
Bar charts showing the breakdown of activity types.

#### 5. Machine Learning
##### Clustering: I will identify patterns in usage behavior by grouping similar days based on screen time and activity types.
##### Prediction: I will explore simple models (e.g., linear regression) to predict future usage patterns based on historical data.

#### 6. Reporting
I will summarize key findings in a structured report.
I will discuss limitations and propose ideas for future work like monitoring other apps and combining multiple social media platforms
